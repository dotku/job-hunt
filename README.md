# job-hunt

Finding a desired job is not just for covering the living cost, but it is also a invest for your future, 
and your dream. I think different people might have different standard for their job and dream, 
so what is yours?

## Goal

I'm trying to create a platform for job seekers to shout out their voice, instead of sale self in the market.
I want you call out from your soul, what's your dream life and dream job?

## Challenge and Problems

Challenge 1. People are shy or afraid to explose their own self  
Solution: it needs create a privice control manager to help them match the disierd company, 
without hurting their current position or life.

## Principles

1. Innovation  
Innovation is about to create something new, it is not neccessary to be the hottest thing in the industry or 
in the world. It is more about the founder's desire.

2. Success  
The key for success is pretty simple actually: you can keep your business going, that's success already.

3. Popular/Famous  
Most of people might just thinking of list their company to the market would be defined as successful; 
but it is actually just one step of many possibilities. Server private companies are also successful. 
Continous popularity would be the key. It make your company famous.

4. World Wide Impact  
Many local stores are pouplar, but they are just local store. The best few (it might be the 500 hundreds) 
are always have world wide impact.
