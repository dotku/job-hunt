# job-hunt

Finding a desired job is not just for covering the living cost, but it is also a invest for your future, 
and your dream. I think different people might have different standard for their job and dream, 
so what is yours?

## Goal

I'm trying to create a platform for job seekers to shout out their voice, instead of sale self in the market.
I want you call out from your soul, what's your dream life and dream job?

## Challenge and Problems

Chllnege 1. People are shy or afraid to explose their own self  
Solution: it needs create a privice control manager to help them match the disierd company, 
without hurting their current position or life.
